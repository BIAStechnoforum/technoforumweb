            <p class="content">Any technology-based knowledge needs to be both theoretical as well as practical, and
              Technoforum is one such platform where they focus on increasing the knowledge and skills of any student
              with any technology they
              want by project-based learning.
              Project-based learning is one of the most appreciated ways to learn and explore new technologies.
              Technoforum believes in project-based learning and encourages the student to explore different
              technologies by providing a platform to
              showcase their projects. It not only helps the student gain knowledge about a particular technology but
              builds up self-confidence, critical thinking skills, and project management skills.

                                                the applications of these fields.
                                                It involves the conception, design, manufacture, and operation
                                                of robots. Robotics is creating machines that can perform human actions
                                                such as walking, running, speaking, etc. Robotics has various
